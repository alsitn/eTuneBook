Abc Tunebook Manager
www.etunebook.ch
--------------------

With eTuneBook you can manage your tunebook in the browser, edit and view Abc tunes, combine tunes to sets, have a quick look at the first bars of a tune (e.g. on your smart phone during a session), remember when you last played a tune and how good you were, label tunes with a color or add a comment, store links to other sites holding tune informations and jump to those sites by clicking the site buttons, store links to YouTube videos and view them in eTuneBook by clicking the video buttons, easily identify those tunes you should rehearse (just sort by last play dates, rehearse frequency or skill), find tunes by title, key, type or color.

eTuneBook uses abcjs, angular.js, twitter bootstrap, colorPicker.js, FileReader, LocalStorage and AppCache. 

Tunebooks are stored on the client (local storage). 

eTunebook should be run in Chrome (or Firefox as second option).
